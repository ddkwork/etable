Docs: [GoDoc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/emer/etable/clust)

`clust` implements agglomerative clustering of items based on [simat](https://github.com/emer/etable/tree/master/simat) similarity matrix data.

`GlomClust` is the main function, taking different `DistFunc` options for comparing distance between items.
