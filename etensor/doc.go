Package etensor provides a basic set of tensor data structures
(n-dimensional arrays of data), based on apache/arrow/go/tensor
and intercompatible with those structures.

The primary differences are:
  - pure simple unidimensional Go slice used as the backing data array, auto allocated
  - fully modifiable data -- arrow is designed to be read-only
  - Shape struct is fully usable separate from the tensor data
  - Everything exported, e.g., Offset method on Shape
  - int used instead of int64 to make everything easier -- target platforms
    are all 64bit and have 64bit int in Go by default
